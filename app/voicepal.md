Building Mice Craft: A Simplified Storytelling App I'm gonna start building an app called Mice Craft, which uses the mice quotient by Orson's gut card to help people create stories easier. It is a tool for people who wanna write genuine stories, not just, you know, make AI slop. And so it has to have a simple, intuitive, but, you know, useful thing. And so we need the cards, which are opened in act one and closed in act three, and we need try succeed and try fail blocks in act two. Want this to be a simple UI. You know, on the left side, they can craft their story. On the right side, they see the outline kind of in more outline linear form when they refresh. So it doesn't need, you know, complicated UI. The point of this is simplicity so that people can focus really on the narrative and the storytelling in a world where, you know, fancy tools that do a lot for you are dominating. I've tried a lot of the older writing tools and they don't integrate in the latest technology and advances in, you know, for example, with AI or how to have a good UX for these kind of narratives, ducks or stories. And the new ones are a little bit unsatisfying because your stories come out very, you know, almost flat because AI is just doing so much of the heavy lifting for you. And so this is a way where your idea is that you're really gonna be creating an outline, and that outline is your starting point. Um, the outline can use AI. But for that, I just wanna focus on creating the outline. I need to create some requirements for this. Can you give me like, what are some things I need to think about when structuring this and building this? I'm gonna be using the AIR web framework, which is built on top of FastAPI. Yeah. So I think this will be a good tool for both novice and experienced writers. And so the benefit for novice writers is they go to this and they have a narrative structure that's proven that they can follow. And so it helps kind of guide them down the path to how to structure a novel, which is a lot easier than, you know, having a blank page and not knowing, like, how do you create it? You just like start writing like what are there are structures. There are ways to structure and organize a book that aren't involved thinking it through in your head. And this is one of those tools. And so it guides them through that process. For experienced writers who know how to use this narrative structure, it helps them because it lets them manipulate it, you know, faster than they don't have to copy and paste text around and things. You know, they have these cards. They can see it in a visual way. They can see how the cards relate to the outline very quickly and render. And so, um, this is just a, you know, a faster, more convenient tool to use when they wanna use a specific narrative structure. So in general, I think simplicity is functionality. Simplicity is a feature, not an indication that's not not a bug. Now it needs to have be easily understood. The more complicated it is, the more users have to think about things that aren't about their story. And so simplicity is a good thing so that people can focus on their creativity and let the app work for them. This is gonna be a Air app built on top of FastAPI. Air is built on top of FastAPI for the web development framework, and I'm gonna build it with a SQLite, you know, back end. That's just, Yes, for this initial MVP, the primary goal is to help writers create a three-act outline. The only feature for that is creating the outline, so like doing creating those cards and putting them in the right order. Being able to insert and add cards in different orders and then being able to view the outline. It does not require user accounts or sign-in for the MVP. Data should be persisted in SQLite, and we don't need roles at this point. Use your judgement on the fields, I think those look pretty good. I don't need stuff like estimated length, just the minimum for the mice quotient story structure. I don't need image attachments or anything like that, just keep it nice and simple for this first step.

The right side should be a fairly plain bulleted list, using markdowns are fine, just a refresh button is acceptable for MVP. Cards should be reorderable, drag-and-drop is great, I think that would be really nice. Real-time collaboration is not required as a single user thing. We do not need export and publishing or anything like that at this point.

The left side cart area should be vertical, scrolling so she'd go like kind of top to bottom. So there is obviously all the all the mice card start first in the tri accepts are in act two. Since like act one and three are the cards that's in kind of one section, and then act two is the as the try stuff we don't need to worry about scale, the number of users gonna be like five. We don't need to worry about an admin panel to manage template seed cards, user accounts, any of that. Yes, so I think you get the idea, but just keep it very simple.you know, nice for getting something going and prototyping quickly. For UI, I'm gonna use CSS and Tailwind and Daisy UI. I am using Jinja templates, and so you can do those. We wanna use the Daisy UI stuff as much as possible, and then, you know, Tailwind obviously does that. Both of those, just wanna use the CDNs. That means, like, the Tailwind add apply stuff probably won't work. But but, yeah, just use the CDNs for simplicity. I want a side by side layout where the mice cards are on the left side of the screen, and we can kind of order those around. And then on the right side, it renders the outline. I know this won't be the most mobile friendly thing, but that's okay. That's not the point of this MVP yet.
