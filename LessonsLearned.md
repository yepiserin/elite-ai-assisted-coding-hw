# Lessons Learned - Elite AI Assisted Coding

## SpecStory Session Management - October 13, 2025

### **The Issue**
During a significant development session on October 13, 2025, we completed major work but failed to capture it with SpecStory:

- ✅ **Completed Work**: Full drag-and-drop implementation for MICE and Try cards
- ✅ **Database Changes**: Added `order_num` field and reorder functionality  
- ✅ **API Development**: Created batch update endpoints
- ✅ **Problem Solving**: Fixed FastAPI route ordering issues
- ✅ **Git Operations**: Repository setup, merging, and upstream integration
- ✅ **Testing**: Verified functionality with curl commands

### **What Went Wrong**
1. **Missed the Prompt**: AI assistant didn't follow the `AGENTS.md` instruction to prompt for SpecStory session
2. **Infrastructure Only**: Set up SpecStory folders and config but never started actual session
3. **No Session Capture**: All development work went undocumented in SpecStory
4. **Manual Log Only**: Only had a basic development log, not comprehensive session data

### **Root Cause**
The AI assistant got caught up in technical implementation and forgot to follow the established workflow:

> **From AGENTS.md**: "Before starting any development work, you MUST ask the user if they want to start a SpecStory session"

### **Impact**
- **Lost Documentation**: No captured session of the development process
- **Missed Learning**: Can't review the problem-solving approach used
- **No Artifacts**: Missing the detailed interaction history that SpecStory provides
- **Process Gap**: Inconsistent with established workflow

### **Lessons Learned**

#### **For AI Assistants**
1. **Always Prompt First**: Before any development work, ask about SpecStory session
2. **Follow Established Workflows**: Don't skip process steps even when focused on technical work
3. **Session Management**: Ensure SpecStory is actually started, not just configured
4. **Regular Checks**: Verify session is active during long development sessions

#### **For Development Workflow**
1. **Process Discipline**: Stick to established workflows even when excited about technical work
2. **Session Verification**: Confirm SpecStory is running before starting development
3. **Documentation Value**: SpecStory captures valuable problem-solving approaches
4. **Retrospective Value**: Session data helps improve future development

### **Prevention Strategies**
1. **Explicit Prompts**: AI must always ask about SpecStory at session start
2. **Workflow Reminders**: Include SpecStory status in regular check-ins
3. **Session Verification**: Confirm SpecStory is active before major work
4. **Process Documentation**: Keep workflows visible and accessible

### **Key Takeaway**
**Process discipline is as important as technical implementation.** Even when focused on exciting technical work, following established workflows ensures we capture valuable development insights and maintain consistent documentation practices.
