# Cursor Rules for Elite AI Assisted Coding Assignment

## Primary Context Files
- Read and follow instructions in: HW1/demo/4. Assignment/AGENTS.md
- Reference requirements in: HW1/demo/4. Assignment/plan.md  
- Follow development steps in: HW1/demo/4. Assignment/todos.md

## Project Context
This is an assignment for learning context-driven AI development. The goal is to enhance the MICE Quotient Story Builder application with drag-and-drop functionality for Try cards.

## Key Requirements
- Use type hinting where possible
- Maintain separation of concerns without over-abstraction
- No error handling - let the app fail to see full stack traces
- Build real functionality, not mocks
- Verify work using browser automation (app runs on port 8001)
- Reference Air documentation when needed

## SpecStory Session Management
**CRITICAL**: Before starting any development work, you MUST ask the user about SpecStory sessions:

1. **Always Prompt**: When the user starts using AI agents, immediately ask: "Would you like to start a SpecStory session to capture this development work?"

2. **Session Control**: 
   - Sessions are manual start/stop only
   - 30-minute inactivity timeout
   - User controls when to start and stop

3. **Commands to Use**:
   - Start: `specstory start` (run this when user confirms)
   - Stop: `specstory stop` (run this when user wants to end)
   - Status: `specstory status` (check if session is active)

4. **Session Behavior**:
   - No automatic capture
   - User must explicitly start sessions
   - Sessions auto-stop after 30 minutes of inactivity
   - Always prompt before starting new sessions

5. **Workflow**:
   - Ask user about SpecStory session
   - If yes: run `specstory start` and confirm session started
   - If no: proceed with development work
   - Remind user about session timeout (30 minutes)
   - Ask if they want to extend session when approaching timeout

## Current Focus
Implementing Option B: Drag-and-Drop Reordering for Try cards with:
- Sortable.js integration
- Visual feedback system
- Database batch updates
- Error handling and rollback
- Accessibility support
