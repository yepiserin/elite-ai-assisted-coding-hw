## ðŸ§ª **Testing Steps for Drag-and-Drop Functionality**

### **Phase 1: Basic Functionality Testing**
- [ ] **Launch App**: Start the app on port 8000 and verify it loads correctly
- [ ] **Load Sample Data**: Click "Templates" â†’ "Mystery" to load sample Try cards
- [ ] **Verify Drag Handles**: Check that Try cards show `â‹®â‹®` drag handles
- [ ] **Test Basic Drag**: Try dragging a Try card by its handle
- [ ] **Verify Visual Feedback**: Confirm cards show visual feedback during drag (opacity, colors)
- [ ] **Test Reordering**: Drag a card to a new position and verify it stays there
- [ ] **Check Order Numbers**: Verify that order numbers (#1, #2, #3) update correctly

### **Phase 2: Persistence Testing**
- [ ] **Refresh Page**: Reload the page and verify the new order persists
- [ ] **Add New Card**: Create a new Try card and verify it gets the next order number
- [ ] **Reorder with New Card**: Drag the new card to different positions
- [ ] **Verify Database**: Check that order numbers are correctly saved in database

### **Phase 3: Edge Cases Testing**
- [ ] **Empty List**: Clear all data and verify drag handles don't appear
- [ ] **Single Card**: With only one Try card, verify drag handle appears but no reordering needed
- [ ] **Multiple Reorders**: Drag the same card multiple times in different directions
- [ ] **Rapid Dragging**: Try quick successive drags to test performance
- [ ] **Large Dataset**: Add 10+ Try cards and test dragging works smoothly

### **Phase 4: Error Handling Testing**
- [ ] **Network Disconnect**: Disconnect internet during drag and verify error handling
- [ ] **Server Restart**: Restart the app server during a drag operation
- [ ] **Invalid Data**: Try to drag with corrupted card IDs (if possible)
- [ ] **Browser Console**: Check for JavaScript errors during drag operations

### **Phase 5: Cross-Browser Testing**
- [ ] **Chrome**: Test drag-and-drop functionality in Chrome
- [ ] **Firefox**: Test drag-and-drop functionality in Firefox  
- [ ] **Safari**: Test drag-and-drop functionality in Safari (if available)
- [ ] **Mobile**: Test touch interactions on mobile/tablet (if applicable)

### **Phase 6: Integration Testing**
- [ ] **HTMX Compatibility**: Verify drag-and-drop doesn't interfere with HTMX operations
- [ ] **Form Interactions**: Test that drag handles don't interfere with Edit/Delete buttons
- [ ] **Story Timeline**: Verify that reordered Try cards appear correctly in the Story Timeline
- [ ] **Mixed Operations**: Test drag-and-drop while also adding/editing/deleting cards

### **Phase 7: Performance Testing**
- [ ] **Smooth Animation**: Verify drag animations are smooth (150ms)
- [ ] **Large Lists**: Test with 20+ Try cards to ensure performance
- [ ] **Memory Usage**: Check browser memory usage during extended drag sessions
- [ ] **CPU Usage**: Monitor CPU usage during drag operations

### **Expected Results**
- âœ… **Drag Handles**: Try cards should show `â‹®â‹®` handles that are clickable
- âœ… **Visual Feedback**: Cards should show opacity changes and color changes during drag
- âœ… **Smooth Animation**: 150ms animation should be smooth and responsive
- âœ… **Order Persistence**: New order should persist after page refresh
- âœ… **Database Updates**: Order numbers should update correctly in database
- âœ… **Error Recovery**: Failed drags should reload page to reset order
- âœ… **No Conflicts**: Drag-and-drop should not interfere with other app functionality

### **Success Criteria**
- [ ] **All Phase 1 tests pass** - Basic drag-and-drop works
- [ ] **All Phase 2 tests pass** - Order persists correctly  
- [ ] **All Phase 3 tests pass** - Edge cases handled properly
- [ ] **All Phase 4 tests pass** - Error handling works
- [ ] **All Phase 5 tests pass** - Cross-browser compatibility
