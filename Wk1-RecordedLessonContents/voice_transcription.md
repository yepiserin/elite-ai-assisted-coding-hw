I'm looking to build an app. I have a directory created called tzconverter which has the quick start guide for Air, which is a web development framework built on top of FastAPI. I would like to use Air to create this application and have the interactivity use HTMX.

I would like this to be an app that a user can go in and put in their time in AM/PM format to select a time they might like to meet, where they can compare it to a lot of other major time zones. Let's start with maybe San Francisco, Chicago, Washington, D.C., a few European time zones, Manila time, Australia, maybe Sydney, whatever some of the standard ones are like the big ones. Make sure it's kind of worldwide; we don't need every single one, just pick a decent number that covers the big regions.

When I select a time, I would like it to show what those times are in those time zones. For example, I'm in Washington, D.C. If I say Washington, D.C. at 7 p.m., that's my time; I want it to give me the time in all the others. Washington, D.C. will just show 7 p.m.; we don't need any fancy conversion there. Other zones should show different information. For example, the European time zones—London is five hours ahead—so it should show that. For Manila, I believe that's a 12‑hour gap, so if I say 7 p.m. Washington, D.C. it should show 7 a.m. Manila tomorrow, or 4 p.m. San Francisco today, and so on. I'm not putting in any date selectors, but it should indicate whether that particular time is today, yesterday, or tomorrow depending on the time zone entered.

I also just want it really easy; I don't want to read them all to find good times. So when I enter a time, make things a very light subtle green if they're at a good convenient business time, something like 9 am to 4 pm local time. If it's something like 6 am to 9 am or 4 pm to 10 pm, make it yellow as inconvenient. And if it's outside of that, like 10 pm to 6 am, it should be red as that's an unacceptable time to meet.

This is an MVP. I want to keep it simple. I don't need multi-user or authentication. You can store everything in the local session. I just want to get a simple proof of concept created first.

The user should select their time in a drop‑down time picker to make things easier. If local time‑zone detection is easy, that’s great, but manually selecting the time zone is fine. Let’s just make the time zone manually set up. My headquarters is in Washington, D.C., so make that the default for everyone who uses the app. The time display should be 12‑hour a.m./p.m. Don’t worry about daylight‑saving time; always assume standard time for now. I understand that might not be perfectly accurate. I’ll work on time‑zone handling later because it gets tricky. When the user changes the time input, it should update the conversions automatically with HTMLX triggering on change. For the display, city names are ideal. We don’t need abbreviated time‑zone labels, just city names since we know people’s location more than their time zone.

I don't need this to work well for mobile, and yes, those look like yours. So go ahead and pick the 8-12 time zones that are best and use those for the MVP; we can adjust later.
