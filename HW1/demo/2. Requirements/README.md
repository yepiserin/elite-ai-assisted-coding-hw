# Requirements

This verion used good requirements to code with AI, and then dive into the code to understand and refactor it.

Typically you should be refactoring and editing code as you go so your understand it.  But this is to:

1. Get you to see what you can do with good prompting
2. Let you see a clean diff of what I did after AI was done

## What happened

### Context Gathering

1. I used voicepal to transcribe my thoughts for the app.  
2. I then gave that to copilot (GPT-5) and asked it to ask me questions that it would need to know to create a requirements plan based on that.  
3. I then transcribed more.  
4. I asked claude 4.5 to put that into a plan. 
5. I read it and saw it misunderstood the structure
6. I found a blog post about it that I liked, and used the Jina AI reader to conver to markdown
7. I used that as context to improve the plan
8. I heavily edited the plan to what I felt was really great.

### The Coding

I used AI to code.  When it got stuck, I hunter down docs to copy paste doc pages it needed directly into the chat, etc.  I copy console errors, and server errors into the chat.  I told it when things weren't working right.  I gave it critiques on how it looked when things weren't readable.

I got a a working app, but it was a lot of fiddling, tweaking, jumping between screens, and copy paste.
