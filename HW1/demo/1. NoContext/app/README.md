# Starting Air

## Why Air?

Air is a web framework built on FastAPI by Dani and Audrey Rohr-Grenfeld.

Three reasons I'm using it for this course:

1. Built on FastAPI—proven, popular foundation
2. New—minimal model training data. Forces you to work with context, not memorization
3. I like it. Use what works for you. Rebuilding these exercises in your preferred framework is excellent practice

## Why use something not in the training data?

If AI can write 100% of your code in TypeScript, use TypeScript.

For everything else, you need other skills. Your team's expertise matters. Internal libraries exist. Private repos exist. Commercial projects have code that will never be in training data.

You need to work effectively when base LLM knowledge isn't enough.
